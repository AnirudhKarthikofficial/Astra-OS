# KassOS

KassOS is currently a kernel written in x86 Assembly that was designed to run on a Dell Inspiron 1525. This "Operating System" is a heavly WIP. The current versions, v0.0.5 and Beta v0.0.5, are the only supported version as of now. Once Beta v0.1.0 releases, these versions will lose support. By the end of 2025, the plan is to have a fully functional Operating System with a fully custom Bootloader. 

# Support

While v0.0.5 and Beta v0.0.5 are supported, I will not be assisting if you have any problems running it. If you need help using NASM, you can go to their website [NASM](https://www.nasm.us), or go to TechHub (a temp server) [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XP7JxVBHA2). If anymore information is needed, contact YourLocalDumbassBitch within the server.

# Hardware and Virtualiztion 

KassOS was originally developed to run on a Dell Inspiron 1525 with an Intel Core2Duo, so if you want the original experince I suggest you get one. If you want to run KassOS inside a VM, I suggest you use QEMU as it's given the best results.
