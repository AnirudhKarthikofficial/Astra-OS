# CassOS
This is was an old project that I started last year but stopped. I do have a vote on my youtube page (@ozziebeanie2) asking if I should work more on it or not.

# Hardware
This does work on both VMs and Real Hardware. If you wish to use it on real hardware, you can use a tool such as rufus to write it on a usb or another type of drive.

## Commands
Only has a help, uname, and uname -s command.
