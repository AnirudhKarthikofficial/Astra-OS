# KassOS

Astro is currently a kernel written in x86 Assembly that was designed to run on a Dell Inspiron 1525. This "Operating System" is a heavly WIP. The current versions, v0.0.5 and Beta v0.0.5, are the only supported version as of now.  By the end of 2025, the plan is to have a fully functional Operating System with a fully custom Bootloader.

# Hardware and Virtualiztion 

KassOS was originally developed to run on a Dell Inspiron 1525 with an Intel Core2Duo (for Legacy Updates), so if you want the original experince I suggest you get one. If you want to run KassOS inside a VM, I suggest you use QEMU as it's given the best results.

# Getting Changed 

This OS, is getting changed and will be updated, this OS KassOS will be changed to AstraOS due to the previous owner asking to change the name since he wanted the name "KassOS" but the OS is still a legacy and will get updates.
